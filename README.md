# Object Tracking in Highways with Opencv and Python

Object tracking: It does frame-by-frame tracking but keeps the history of where the object is at a time after time

## Steps:

-  Creation of a mask in highway.mp4 file

- Focusing the attention on objects that are larger than a certain area

- Drawing the contours with OpenCVâ€™s cv2.drawContours function

- Defining a region of interest ROI and apply the mask only in this area

- Integrate the tracking functions and associate unique ID to the object

- Below image shows the result:
